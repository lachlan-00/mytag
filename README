mytag: Python tag editor

Why:
tagtool sucks so I'm making a GTK3 ID3v2.4 compatible replacement.

About:
This is a program to bring all the requirements of managing music files together into one program. I have written a lot of music and file organisation programs for myself and the major software in this area just doesn't fit my needs.

News:
-The interface is basically feature complete now. (finally!)
-I will be integrating my work with:
   * pOrganiser for organising your music library per folder.
        (Currently unreleased...)
   * possibly pySyncP3[1] as well.
-Probably add set tags from filename feature as well.

These extra features highlight how much tagging programs are missing when you are editing.
Just because you're editing tags doesn't mean that your files are corect either!

Requires:
python 2.7 and python-eyed3 to be installed.
