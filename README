mytag: Python tag editor

Why:
tagtool sucks so I'm making a GTK3 ID3v2.4 compatible replacement.

News:
 * Feature complete!

About:
This is a program to bring all the requirements of managing music files together into one program.
I have written a lot of music and file organisation programs for myself and the major software in this area just doesn't fit my needs.

Features other taggers don't have:
 * Fast and simple file tagging process
 * set tags and organise files according to their tag in a fast and easy way.

Supported output variables:
%title% - Track title
%artist% - Track artist
%albumartist% - Album artist
%album% - Album title
%year% - Album release year
%disc% - Disc number
%track% - Track number

*NOTE: %albumartist% will fall back to artist when not available.
       This has been the best way i've found to manage multiple
       artist CD's/

Organisation example:
 * Output Style: %albumartist%/%year% %album%/%disc%-%track% - %title%
 * Input: /music/new/spawn soundtrack/01 - filter & the crystal method - trip like i do.mp3
 * Set Album Artist to 'Various'.
 * Output: /music/Various/1997 Spawn/1-01 - Can't You (Trip Like I Do).mp3


These extra features highlight how much tagging programs are missing when you are editing.
Just because you're editing tags doesn't mean that your files are corect either!

Requires:
 * python 2.7
 * python-eyed3
 * gnome-icon-theme
